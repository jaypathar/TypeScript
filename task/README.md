This program is a comprehensive Banking Management System that provides various features to facilitate
banking operations. It utilizes TypeScript concepts for robust and type-safe development.

  amount and ensures that it does not exceed the available balance. Once the withdrawal is confirmed, the
  system updates the account balance accordingly.

  validates the deposit value and updates the account balance accordingly.

  transactions within a specified time period. The program retrieves the transaction data and presents it
  in a readable format.
